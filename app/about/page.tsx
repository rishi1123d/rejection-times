            The Rejection Times was founded on a simple premise: behind every success story lies a trail of rejections,
            setbacks, and failures that are rarely discussed but often instrumental to ultimate achievement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to celebrate these moments of rejection and illuminate the path from disappointment to
            triumph. By sharing these stories, we hope to change the narrative around failure and inspire others to
            persevere through their own challenges.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>

          <p>
            We believe that rejection is not the end of a journey, but often the beginning of a more meaningful one. The
            stories featured in The Rejection Times demonstrate that setbacks can be catalysts for growth, innovation,
            and unexpected opportunities.
          </p>
